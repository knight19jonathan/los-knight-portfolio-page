            A Seattle web based applications service provider educated locally through the Coding Bootcamp Program. Previously worked in Emergency Medical Services as EMT primarly in downtown Seattle. Routinely perfromed tasks that range from minor medical care and first on scene emergency response to delivering babies and treating victims of gunshot wounds. Prior to that in the United States Army as an Engineer Officer primarily leading a platoon focused on route clearance and improvsied explosive device (IED) reduction in Iraq as part of Operation New Dawn in 2011.  After working in many different fields I've always been interesed in learning to code and web development.  My dad worked most of my teenage years as a self employed home computer repair and technician and it got me interested in learning to code but I never took the chance to learn. Twenty years later seems a little late to start a new skill set but I am excited for this challenge.
